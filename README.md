- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @HunterSaine
- I'm just starting out on my programming journey, and I have had a lot of fun learning so far. I'm working my way through The Odin Project right now, so you will probably notice that most of my projects are related to that. I have a BS in Political Science, and I'm starting my journey towards a second degree in January. My second degree will be a BS in Computer Science from Oregon State University.
