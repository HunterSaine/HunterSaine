- Hi, welcome to my profile. My name is Hunter, and I'm a software engineering student at Western Governors University. My profile mainly consist of personal projects, but I'm hoping to begin contributing to some open source projects when I'm more comfortable with my skills. If you have any feedback or advice, you can reach me on Linkedin https://www.linkedin.com/in/hunter-saine/

Happy Coding!
